Performance Evaluation of C/C++, MicroPython, Rust and TinyGo Programming Languages on ESP32 Microcontroller
"The results of this study reveal that, though the C/C++ programming language is widely believed to be the most efficient for embedded programming, that is not always the case....in a few cases the C/C++ algorithms were outperformed by algorithms implemented in TinyGo and Rust. Moreover, the TinyGo algorithms demonstrated jitter-free execution, making this language more preferable for hard real-time applications."
